# Scientific-Programming
A collection of code from NYU's Scientific Programming for Behavioral Sciences course. Provided by the course and written by me.

# Description: 
Scientific programming and computing is an increasingly critical skillset in all
sciences. This course is designed to develop these skills by covering computational and
programming needs across the entire research cascade, from stimulus creation to making
publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming. Language of instruction is Matlab.
Objective: Allowing aspiring researchers without any background in programming to acquire
the necessary fluency in scientific programming and computing to implement these methods
to pursue their own research projects, from data recording to publication and being in a
position to successfully and confidently continue to explore scientific programming after the
conclusion of the class, in short to become “code-safe”.
